# Threat Actor

A threat actor (aka malicious actor) is either an individual or a group of people (up to and including multiple nation states) that use capabilities (e.g. technical tools) to exploit vulnerabilities in order to cross a trust boundary and gain some advantage (e.g. access to information, disabling the power grid)
