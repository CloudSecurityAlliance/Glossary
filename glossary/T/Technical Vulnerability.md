# Technical vulnerability

Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in the design, implementation, operation, or management of an information technology system, device, or service that provides access to cyber threat actors. For example, a threat actor may attempt to install malicious software, called malware, or take advantage of existing flaws to exploit the targeted system. In addition to installing malware, threat actors also use tools that directly exploit specific technical vulnerabilities.
