# Obfuscation

Obfuscation refers to the tools and techniques that threat actors use to hide their identities, goals, techniques, and even their victims. In order to avoid leaving clues that defenders could use to attribute the activity, threat actors can use either common, readily available tools and techniques or custom-built tools that covertly send information over the Internet.
