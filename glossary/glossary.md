# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Biometrics

A rare two-factor authentication strategy is to require a biometric authentication in addition to a password. This is rare because most users do not have access to good biometric scanners such as a finger print reader or iris scanner. Some sites now use facial recognition in combination with web cameras in order to implement this.

# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Hardware Token

A common two-factor authentication strategy is to have the user either generate a one time code on their end using a hardware token such as an RSA token, or a U2F/FIDO compliant hardware token such as a Yubikey or a Google Titan key. The token that simply generate a one time code that the user types in are vulnerable to phishing attacks, however the hardware tokens implementing protocols such as U2F are more secure as they include the URL in the authentication request and it must be correct, an attacker can't simple use a similar looking domain to host their attack.

# Attack Against Consensus Mechanisms

A number of attacks can be made against the consensus mechanism used by a Blockchain/DLT. The classic attack is of course to get enough resources to mount a 51% attack (please note that this percentage varies, e.g. in Byzantine Fault Tolerance based networks 34% is usually sufficient), in simple terms this means getting enough computational power, or proof of stake or whatever resource the consensus mechanism relies upon to control the data being written to the Blockchain/DLT.

It should also be noted that based on the consensus model being used the 51% attack provides a high probability of success, attackers can mount the attack with less resources but they are less likely to succeed.

Additionally there are attacks that can aid in reducing the complexity and resources needed to mount a 51% attack, for example by knocking large miners or mining pools offline the attacker can reduce the amount of computational resources they would need to mount a 51% attack.

# Bitcoin 0.9 Standard Transaction Types

As of bitcoin core 0.9, transactions from the network must match a set of
rules, Those transactions are called standard transactions. Only standard
transactions are mined or broadcast by peers running the default Bitcoin
Core software. The standard transaction types are as follows:
1. Pay to PubKey Hash (P2PKH) - standard way to send Bitcoins to a single
address
2. Pay to Address - standard way of assigning newly mined Bitcoins and
transaction fees to an address
3. Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) - moves the responsibility for supplying the
conditions to redeem a transaction from the creator of the transaction
to the payee(s)
4. Multi-Signature - used for multi-signature transactions by specifying the
multi-signature script in the P2SH (#3) redeemScript, they can also be
specified directly in the scriptPubKey
5. Null_Data - They allow the creator of the transaction to include some
arbitrary data in the blockchain in exchange for paying a transaction fee.
The output is unspendable
6. Non_Standard – None of the above

# Bitcoin Currency

is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using
cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of
additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative
currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.
Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then,
numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called
altcoins, as a blend of bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin and its derivatives use
decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money/centralized
banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin’s
blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.

# Bitcoin Payment System

is peer-to-peer with transactions taking place between users directly,
without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes
and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which
uses bitcoin as its unit of account. Since the system works without a central
repository or single administrator, the U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a
decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency,
although prior systems existed and it is more correctly described as the first
decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of
total market value.

# Bitcoin Transaction Locktime

The Bitcoin transaction lock time is the time at which a particular transaction
can be added to the blockchain. This is the earliest time that miners can
include the transaction in their hashing of the Merkle root to attach it in the
latest block to the blockchain.There are two specific types of transaction
locktime. Firstly when the locktime figure is less than 500 million it is
interpreted as a block height and miners therefore have to wait until that block
height has been reached before attempting to include it in a block. If it is above
500 million it is converted to a unix timestamp – a unix timestamp being the
number of seconds since January 1st 1970.

# Blockchain Applications

A blockchain application requires three interdependent components: the userfacing application, the smart contract, and the ledger.
The top layer is the user-facing application that meets the needs of the
network participants. The application lets users invoke smart contracts that
trigger transactions in the business network. The smart contract encapsulates
the business logic of the network: assets, ownership, and transfers. Each
invocation of a smart contract creates a transaction in the network and
updates the ledger. The ledger holds the current value of smart contract data
(for example, vehicleOwner=Daisy), and is distributed across the network.

# Blockchain Mining Hardware

CPU/GPU Bitcoin Mining: The least powerful category of bitcoin mining
hardware is your computer itself. Theoretically, you could use your computer’s
CPU to mine for bitcoins, but in practice, this is so slow by today’s standards
that there isn’t any point. You can enhance your bitcoin hash rate by adding
graphics hardware to your desktop computer. Graphics cards feature
graphical processing units (GPUs). These are designed for heavy mathematical
lifting so they can calculate all the complex polygons needed in high-end video
games. This makes them particularly good at the SHA hashing mathematics
necessary to solve transaction blocks. For example, an ATI 5970 graphics card
can give you over 800 MH/sec compared with a CPU, which will generally give
you less than 10 MH/sec.

FPGA Bitcoin Mining: A Field Programmable Gate Array is an integrated
circuit designed to be configured after being built. This enables a mining
hardware manufacturer to buy the chips in volume, and then customize them
for bitcoin mining before putting them into their own equipment. Because
they are customized for mining, they offer performance improvements over
CPUs and GPUs. Single-chip FPGAs have been seen operating at around 750
Megahashes/sec, although that’s at the high end.
ASIC Bitcoin Miners: This is where the action’s really at. Application Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are specifically designed to do just one thing: mine
bitcoins at mind-crushing speeds, with relatively low power consumption.
Because these chips have to be designed specifically for that task and then
fabricated, they are expensive and time-consuming to produce - but the
speeds are stunning. At the time of writing, units are selling with speeds
anywhere from 5-500 Gigahashes/sec (although actually getting some of them
to them to ship has been a problem).

# Blockchain Pruning

It is not required for most fully validating nodes to store the entire blockchain,
currently around 127 GB. Reducing the amount of data to the size of the
current unspent output size, currently 1.7 GB, plus some additional for data
that is needed to handle re-orgs can reduce the stress on many nodes.

# Blockchain RTBF Risk

Due to the existence of multiple copies of the entire transaction database
it would be difficult to prove all data had been deleted. The fact that data
in the blockchain is immutable – which means that it cannot be altered or
removed once it has been entered – provides transparency and accountability.
However, it may also compromise privacy and data protection, especially when
it comes to personal or sensitive data (which should never be stored on a
blockchain). Blockchains do not guarantee anonymity and, the more personal
the data is, the easier it is to identify the individual to which it pertains. This
immutability may compromise the ‘right to be forgotten’, whereby users may,
under certain circumstances, demand that their personal data be erased.

# Blockchain

Originally block chain — is a distributed database that maintains a
continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block
contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By design blockchains are
inherently resistant to modification of the data — once recorded, the data in
a block cannot be altered retroactively. Blockchains are "an open, distributed
ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a
verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can also be programmed to
trigger transactions automatically.

ChainLocks is a defensive mechanism that helps prevent 51% Attacks by having the network vote on the "first seen" block, if enough of the network votes for a given block it is accepted. This done by using special Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs) nodes and thus prevents an attacker from showing up with a pre-mined chain (their blocks would not have been previously seen and voted on).

# Chaincode Standard Transaction Types

The standard transaction types are as follows:
1. Init () - when you first deploy your chaincode. This should be used to initialize your chaincode.
2. Invoke () - when you want to call chaincode functions to do real work
3. Query () - whenever you query your chaincode’s state.
4. Main () – when it’s time to setup the communication between the chaincode & the peer that deployed it.

# Chaincode

Chaincode is the Hyperledger fabric’s interpretation of the smart contract
method/algorithm, with additional features. Embedded logic that encodes the
rules for specific types of network transactions. Developers write chaincode
applications and deploy them to the network. End users then invoke
chaincode through a client-side application that interfaces with a network
peer, or node. Chaincode runs network transactions, which if validated, are
appended to the shared ledger and modify world state.

# Confirmation

A confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the
network. This happens through a process known as mining, in a proof-of-work
system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed
or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it
becomes to perform a double spend attack.

# Consortium blockchains

a consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is
controlled by a preselected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a
consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and
of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid. The right
to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and
there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being
public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a
limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts
of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered "partially
decentralized".

# Cryptographic Hashes

such as the SHA256 computational algorithm, produce a fixed-size, unique
hash value, known as a digest, from variable-sized transaction input. Hashes
feature a mathematical property in which a hash can be arrived at uniquely
from a given input, but the input cannot be derived from its hash value. A given
specific input always results in the same hash value being computed.

Any modifications or alterations to transaction input — even the most
minuscule change — results in a different hash value being computed, which
indicates potentially compromised transaction input. Thus, the hash value can
be used to detect the integrity of the transaction input.

# Decentralized Acyclic Graph (DAG)

A Decentralized Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph (a collections of nodes and edges) that does not have any cycles, or in simple terms no node is connected to other nodes in a way that forms loops. Please note that in a blockchain style data structure a DAG may have nodes that are connected to each other via edges, but these edges have a direction (e.g. the newer block has a hash of the older block, of course an older block cannot have a hash of a non existent "newer" block) so there may be a situation where A is connect to B and C, and B is connected to C but data can only travel from A to B and C, and from B to C, the data cannot loop around (e.g. from C to A).

DAG based systems are sometimes referred to as "tangle" chains as they often have interwoven structures like ivy or related plants.

# Decentralized App (DAPP)

Decentralized App (DAPP) are a type of software program designed to exist on the Internet in a way that is
not controlled by any single entity. For an application to be considered a Dapp it
must meet the following criteria:
Application must be completely open-source - It must operate autonomously,
and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may
adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback
but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.
Application’s data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored - in
a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.
Application must use a cryptographic token - (bitcoin or a token native to its
system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of
value from (miners /farmers) should be rewarded in the application’s tokens.
Application must generate tokens - according to a standard cryptographic
algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application
(Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work Algorithm).

# Distributed Ledger

(also called shared ledger or register) a consensus of replicated, shared,
and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites,
countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralized
data storage. A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus
algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken. One distributed
ledger design is through implementation of a public or private blockchain
system. But all distributed ledgers do not have to necessarily employ a chain
of blocks to successfully provide secure and valid achievement of distributed
consensus, a Blockchain is only one type of data structure considered to be
a distributed ledger.

# Double Spending

Double spend refers to a scenario, in the Bitcoin network, where someone
tries to send a bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at the same time.

However, once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible
to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has,
the harder it becomes to double spend the bitcoins.

# Ethereum

Ethereum is a programmable open blockchain. Rather than give users a set
of predefined operations (e.g. bitcoin transactions), Ethereum allows users
to create their own operations of any complexity they wish. In this way, it
serves as a platform for many different types of decentralized blockchain
applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies. At the heart
of it is the Ethereum Virtual Machine ("EVM"), which can execute code of
arbitrary algorithmic complexity. In computer science terms, Ethereum is
"Turing complete". Developers can create applications that run on the EVM
using friendly programming languages modelled on existing languages like
JavaScript and Python.

# Finality

Finality refers to a block being accepted in a blockchain such that it is valid and final. Some blockchains have probabilistic finality, that is a block is probably final, and as it gets older that probability rises (e.g. in Blockchain), some have absolute finality, that is once a block is accepted, it's accepted, and there is also economic finality, in which it becomes very expensive to revert a finalized bock.

Many attacks involve trying to abuse finality mechanisms or delay them so that attacker controlled blocks are treated as finalized.

# Fork

a regular fork where all nodes follow the same consensus rules, so the fork
is resolved once one chain has more proof of work than another. When two
or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain. Typically
occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time. Can also
happen as part of an attack.

# Front Running Attacks

Front running attacks are a common strategy for attackers to exploit information gaps or latencies and execute trades quickly in order to gain an advantage.

Some common strategies include monitoring public Mempools, public oracles and public exchanges and distributed exchanges to spot opportunities.

Defenses against front running typically involve reducing latency by moving trading systems closer to exchanges or putting them on high speed, low latency networks in the case of distributed exchanges, and running your own mining pool or miners in order to execute transactions without having to send them to the Mempool.

# HardFork

A permanent divergence in the blockchain, commonly occurs when nonupgraded nodes can’t validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow
newer consensus rules. A hardfork is a change to the blockchain protocol that
makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all
users to upgrade their clients. The most recent example of a hardfork in public
blockchains is the Ethereum hardfork which happened on July 21st 2016.
The hardfork changed the Ethereum protocol, therefore second blockchain
emerged (Ethereum Classic, ETC) which supports the old Ethereum protocol.
In order to continue existing ETC needs miners, which would validate the
transactions on the blockchain.

Services provides a distinction of roles by combining elements of Public

non-permissioned networks do not provide member-specific authority or a
distinction of roles.
A permissioned blockchain requires entities to register for long-term
identity credentials (Enrollment Certificates), which can be distinguished
according to entity type. For users, an Enrollment Certificate authorizes the
Transaction Certificate Authority (TCA) to issue pseudonymous credentials;
these certificates authorize transactions submitted by the user. Transaction
certificates persist on the blockchain, and enable authorized auditors to
associate otherwise unlinkable transactions.

# Merkle Root

The root node of a Merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the
tree. Block headers must include a valid Merkle root descended from all
transactions in that block.
Source: https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/merkle-root

# Merkle Tree

Basic idea behind Merkle tree is to have some piece of data that is linking
to another. You can do this by linking things together with a cryptographic
hash. The content itself can be used to determine the hash. By using the
cryptographic hashing, we can address the content, and content gets
immutable because if you change anything in the data the cryptographic
hash changes and the link will be different. Bitcoin uses cryptographic
hashing, where every block points to the previous one, if you modify the
block, the hash will change and will make the block invalid.

# Nakamoto Consensus

is the decentralized mechanism for emergent consensus. Emergent, because
consensus is not achieved explicitly—there is no election or fixed moment
when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent artifact of the
asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all following
simple rules. Decentralized consensus emerges from the interplay of four
processes that occur independently on nodes across the network:

* Independent verification of each transaction, by every full node, based on a comprehensive list of criteria
* Independent aggregation of those transactions into new blocks by mining nodes, coupled with demonstrated computation through a proof-of-work algorithm
* Independent verification of the new blocks by every node and assembly into a chain
* Independent selection, by every node, of the chain with the most cumulative computation demonstrated through proof of work

# Nonce

is an arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication,
in the spirit of a nonce word. They are often random or pseudo-random
numbers. Many nonces also include a timestamp to ensure exact timeliness,
though this requires clock synchronization between organizations. The
addition of a client nonce ("cnonce") helps to improve the security in some
ways as implemented in digest access authentication. To ensure that a nonce
is used only once, it should be time-variant (including a suitably fine-grained
timestamp in its value), or generated with enough random bits to ensure
a probabilistically insignificant chance of repeating a previously generated
value. Some authors define pseudo-randomness (or unpredictability) as a
requirement for a nonce.

Pegged Sidechains

is the creation of another blockchain to be used to transfer Bitcoins and
assets from one blockchain to another. Several advantage of Pegged
Sidechains are:
1. Access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets
they already own
2. More easily interoperate with each other and with Bitcoin
3. Avoiding the liquidity shortages and market fluctuations associated with
new currencies
4. Since sidechains are separate systems, technical and economic
innovation is not hindered
5. Despite bidirectional transferability between Bitcoin and pegged
sidechains, they are isolated:
a. in the case of a cryptographic break (or malicious design) in a
sidechain, the damage is entirely confined to the sidechain itself.

# Permissioned Ledger

A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to
access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners.
When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited
consensus process. This is carried out by trusted actors which makes
maintaining a shared record much simpler that the consensus process
used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide
highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital
signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is usually
faster than an unpermissioned ledger.

# Private Blockchain

a fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are
kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public
or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database
management, auditing, etc. internal to a single company, and so public
readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases
public auditability is desired.

# Proof of Authority (PoA)

Proof-of-Authority is a replacement for Proof-of-Work, which can be used
for private chain setups. It does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily
difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a hard-configured set of
"authorities" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and
secure the blockchain. This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and
keep the block issuers accountable. A Proof of authority is a consensus
mechanism in a private blockchain which essentially gives one client (or a
specific number of clients) with one particular private key the right to make
all of the blocks in the blockchain.

A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be
hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional
variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a
block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and
computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.

Some Blockchains also use storage as a form of work (e.g. FileCoin).

# Public Blockchain

is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can
send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and
anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process
for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current
state is. As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public
blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic
incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of
work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which
someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional
to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These
blockchains are generally considered to be "fully decentralized".

The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is one of a number of cryptographic hash
functions. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a text or a data file.
SHA-256 algorithm generates an almost-unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte)
hash. Hash is a one way function – it cannot be decrypted back. This makes it
suitable for password validation, challenge hash authentication, anti-tamper,
digital signatures. SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1,
and is one of the strongest hash functions available.

# Schnorr Signatures

is a signature algorithm replacement for ECDSA, leveraging elliptic curve
cryptography that supports "native multisig" which enables the aggregation

* Constant-size signatures irrespective of the number of participants in the multisig setup.
* Diminished size of data to be validated and transmitted translates into capacity gains.
* Entire policy of multisig is obscured and indistinguishable from a conventional single pubkey.

# Script

is a simple programming language, which is evaluated from left to right

A script is essentially a list of instructions recorded with each transaction
that describe how the next person wanting to spend the Bitcoins being
transferred can gain access to them. The script for a typical Bitcoin transfer
to destination Bitcoin address D simply encumbers future spending of the
bitcoins with two things: the spender must provide:
1. a public key that, when hashed, yields destination address D embedded
in the script, and
2. a signature to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the
public key just provided.

Technically, "Segregated witness (Segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will
allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction
signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is
covered by the txid."

# Sharding

In a sharding, nodes hold a subset of the state (UTXOs), and a subset of the
blockchain. Instead of miners/validators redundantly doing the same work,
they are going share the load but still have an only economic assurance
even though they’re not going to validate every transaction. For example, a
sharding scheme on Ethereum might put all addresses starting with 0x00
into one shard, all addresses starting with 0x01 into another shard, etc. In a
simple version of the scheme, each user maintains a light client on all shards,
while validators fully download and track a few shards that they are assigned
to at some particular time.

# Shared Ledger

The shared ledger is the single source of truth, or the entire history of
validated transactions, on a blockchain network. Any discrepancies in the
shared ledger across nodes are resolved through consensus. The ledger has
the following attributes:
* It records all validated transactions on the network.
* It is shared across all network participants.
* It is replicated, so that each participant has their own copy.
* It is permissioned, so that participants can only view their own transactions.

# Smart Contract

(also called self-executing contracts, blockchain contracts, or digital
contracts) are simply computer programs that act as agreements where
the terms of the agreement can be preprogrammed with the ability to self-execute and self-enforce itself. The main goal of a smart contract is to enable
two anonymous parties to trade and do business with each other, usually
over the internet, without the need for a middleman. The origin and history
of smart contracts is much older than bitcoin and dates back to the 1990’s.
The term ‘smart contract’ was first coined in 1993 by one of bitcoin’s alleged
creators, Nick Szabo, and referred to self-automated computer programs
that can carry out the terms of any contract.

# Timestamp Blockchain

Cryptocurrencies can serve as decentralized trusted time-stamping services
if hash values of digital data are embedded into the transactions recorded
in the block chain of the crypto currency. When a user submits a file or
plain text through the browser, a client-side Javascript hashes the data.
Alternatively, the data can be hashed offline, e.g., using an open source
tool. In either case, only the hash, not the data is transmitted to the server.
Then a bitcoin transaction, using the smallest amount possible, is created
that includes the document hash. By processing the transaction, the hash
and the timestamp of the transaction are permanently embedded in the
distributed Bitcoin block chain. The timestamp of confirmed transactions and
the data they encode can be verified by inspecting the Bitcoin block chain,
e.g. using websites like blockchain.info.

# Timestamp Trusted

Initially, the original data is hashed. Hashing authenticates the exact data
content, because the hash function ensures that changing a single bit in
the data would generate a different hash value. The hash is then transmitted
to a TSA, which joins the hash with a plain text timestamp. The resulting string,
i.e. the hash combined with the timestamp, is hashed once more and digitally
signed using the TSA’s private key. The resulting ciphertext represents the
trusted timestamp, which, together with the plain text timestamp, is returned
to the requester. The validity of the trusted timestamp can be verified by
decoding the ciphertext using the public key of the TSA. To verify that some data
is identical to the data authenticated by the TSA, the process of creating the
trusted timestamp has to be replicated and the results have to be compared to
the decoded trusted timestamp. The need for a central TSA is a weakness of
established time-stamping approaches, since the integrity of the time-stamping
process is inevitably bound to the integrity of the TSA (Adams et al., 2001).

# Unpermissioned (Permissionless) Ledgers

Unpermissioned ledgers such as Bitcoin have no single owner — indeed,
they cannot be owned. The purpose of an unpermissioned ledger is to allow
anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of

means that no actor can prevent a transaction from being added to the ledger.
Participants maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about
its state dynamically in real-time.

the health of the network. For Example: Node 1: /Satoshi:5.64/bitcoin-qt:0.4/
Node 2: /Satoshi:5.12/Spesmilo:0.8/. Both nodes use the same protocol
version of Bitcoin software but they use different versions of the codebase.

is the risk that the Key generation method used is faulty allowing the

For example a poor random number generator (RNG) can create the same

hashed, this number is multiplied by the same generator point (ie: same
random number) as the public key. Since one unknown has been removed
from the equation, the private key can be revealed by effectively reversing
the hash through additional mathematical operations.
