# Bitcoin Currency

is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using
cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of
additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative
currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.
Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then,
numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called
altcoins, as a blend of bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin and its derivatives use
decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money/centralized
banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin’s
blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.
