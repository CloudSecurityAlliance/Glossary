# Attribution

Attribution is the act of accurately determining the threat actor responsible for a particular set of activities. Successful attribution of a cyber threat actor is important for a number of reasons, including network defense, law enforcement, deterrence, and foreign relations. However, attribution can be difficult as many cyber threat actors attempt to evade attribution through obfuscating their activities.
